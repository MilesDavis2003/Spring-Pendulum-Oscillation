# Coupled Oscillation of a Spring Pendulum

## Overview:
This project simulates the coupled oscillation of a spring pendulum. By defining the equations of motion as a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we use **SciPyâ€™s `odeint`** to numerically solve the system and plot the behavior over time using **Matplotlib**.

## Dependencies:
The project requires the following Python libraries:
1. **Matplotlib**: For plotting the time evolution of the coupled oscillations.
2. **SciPy**: Specifically, `scipy.integrate.odeint` for solving the ODE system.
3. **NumPy**: For numerical operations, including creating a time range for integration.

### How to Install the Required Libraries:
You can install the required libraries using `pip`, the Python package manager. Follow these steps to install them:

### For MacOS, Windows, and Linux:
1. Open your terminal (MacOS/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).
2. Run the following commands to install the necessary packages:
